![The HUB paperweight](thehub.jpg#float-right)
In 1999 I started work at [Clayton State University](http://clayton.edu) as
a student employee. I turned my self-developed troubleshooting skills into a
a job at the university's help desk: [The HUB](http://www.clayton.edu/hub).
After a few years I moved over to the networking department, ostensibly to
help build out and test the wireless network. After graduation, I was brought
back as a full-time employee in the enterprise applications department to support
various backend systems. This role grew into a systems administration role
wherein I was ultimately responsible for the extensive Red Hat Enterprise Linux
infrastructure as the campus's sole Linux administrator. At the same time, I was
responsible for developing and maintaing the university's student web portal.
All the while, I spent my free time working on open source software as a hobby.
That hobby has turned into a new career. Tomorrow I start my new role as a
software engineer at [Knock.com](https://knock.com).

I am genuinely exicited about my path forward. I get to work with some really
smart people and help to grow a company that I think is going to be a major
force for change in the real estate industry. I truly enjoy writing software
that people love to use. And being a part of the team that develops the platform
people will use to make their next home purchase and sale easier will be a
unique experience.

This post has primarily been about marking the occasion for myself. But I also
want to thank the people who moved me foward at Clayton State University:

+ Debye Baird: thank you for taking a chance on the guy that was always hanging
out in the public area of The HUB.
+ Dan Newcombe: thank you for finding a spot on your team for me.
+ Tom Marshall: thank you for brining me on full time.
+ Jason Berry: thank you for trusting in my skills and doing what you could
to keep me around.
