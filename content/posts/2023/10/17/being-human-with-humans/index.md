This post is about my own mental image, and acceptance, of my physical self.
There are nude images ahead, the most revaling of which are obscured behind
a mouse click. I was inspired to write this after [a post][insta] by a
yoga classmate from a yoga class that I started taking in the spring of this
year (2023).

## My Fear

As a child, I played baseball and I remember being quite good at it. I believe
I could have at least earned a scholorship if not gone a step or two further. 
But, I played until I reached the point where to continue would mean two things:

1. Having to get a physical.
2. Having to use a locker room with the rest of the team.

In both cases, the blocker was a fear of being physically exposed in the
presence of other people. I don't really know where this fear originated, but
I'm sure a lot of it came from television or movies portraying body shaming
as an acceptable fact of life in high school and beyond. Regardless of where
it originated, this trepidation has remained with me throughout my adult life.

It wasn't until 2021, on the weekend of my 42nd birthday, that I really decided
to do something about it. It was then that I tried to participate in the
[2021 Philadelphia Naked Bike Ride][pnbr2021] (PNBR). I failed to do that due to
a bad [bike crash]({{<relref "a-bike-crash">}}) on my way to the gathering
spot. So I tried again with [PNBR 2022][pnbr2022] and was successful. It was
liberating. (Unfortunately, due to being out of work, I couldn't attend in
2023.)

## Nude Yoga

The PNBR experience was liberating, at least in part, because it gave me an
opportunity to be a human among other humans. My social skills are terrible.
I had some success at university, but the vast majority of my adult life has
been one of solitude and extreme loneliness. What I learned during the PNBR
experience is that being naked with other people touches something that is
core to our being. Since experiencing that, I _had_ to find a way to get it
close to home, and I wanted the group aspect of it. So I turned to the other
activity I practice regularly: yoga.

{{<clear-both>}}

I started by researching if nude yoga is even a thing. It is. There are
practices like [Naked In Motion][nim], [Dharama House][dhouse],
[Bold Naked][bn], and others around the country. As an aside, see
[this video article][nim-video-article] for a nice overview of Naked In Motion
and [this written article][bn-article] for a Bold Naked experience. I would
certainly like to try out any of these classes if I am able to get a chance.

What I found is that it is quite difficult to find anything in the Atlanta
area. There's one that pops up at the top of search engine results, but it isn't
a class I would attend (it's quite clear the class has extra curricular
motives). All of the others that are "easy" to find are either defunct or
at least unresponsive to inquiries. So eventually I worked up the courage to
ask my regular instructor (shout out to [KIMYB][kimyb]), that I have been taking
classes from since February of 2019, if she knew of any. She didn't even
have to think about it. She was able to point me in the direction of
[The Yoga Playground][yogaplay] and it has been amazing.

Eazy's class is exactly what I was looking for: a co-ed class that is all about
being comfortable with oneself and sharing the experience with others. Just
being in the room allows me to make that base connection, even if my actual
social skills are still poor. But that's another benefit: I actually feel
it's easier to talk to others when we are exposed like that, and I'm getting
better at striking up conversations before and after class.

It's still intimidating to bare it all at the start of every class. I'm always
questioning if I'm doing the right thing by, usually, being the first to get
rid of the shields and storing them with my gear bag in the foyer. But I tell
myself "we're here for a reason, so let's do it." But by the end of class,
particularly on the nights when folks chill and socialize for a bit afterward,
that trepidation is gone. I look forward to each and every class. They fill
a void in my life.

## Conclusion

This has been a bit of a ramble, but I felt that I should get at least some
of it out there. I don't know if it will help anyone else to overcome their
own insecurities, or if I'm just exposing more of myself for the helluva it,
but this is the Room Full of Mirrors.
