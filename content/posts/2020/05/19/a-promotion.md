May 01, 2020 marked two years since I [switched careers]({{< ref "a-new-career" >}}).
That career change was from a "Linux System Adminstrator" to a "Software
Engineer." Today, I was formally promoted to "Senior Software Engeineer."
So I think it is worth taking a few minutes to write down my views on what
switching careers and gaining a new title in that new career has meant to me.

## On Switching Careers

Let's cut to the quick: as I write this I'm 40 years old, and will hit 41 in
three and half short months. When I decided to give up the work I was
comfortable doing, I was four years off from the [median age][median-age] for
white men in the work force. So I was well into the typical timeframe for
an adult's working age range. Switching careers so late was a scary proposition
and one I anguished over. If the position had been with any other company, I'm
fairly certain I would have turned it down.

But having made the change, I can confidently advise people: if the change will
be to a career you know you'll love more than what you currently do, i.e. the
new career is what you _really_ want to do, then do not hesitate. Nothing
compares to switching from a role you are competent at, and merely coasting on,
to one that you genuinely enjoy doing every day. It's worth whatever you consider
to be the risks to make the change. There is a caveat, however: the career
change may be worth it, but the destination might not be. I was extremely lucky
to get recruited to where I am, but if you are not so lucky, do not let the
destination ruin it. Take that resum√© improvement and roll it into another
improvement by finding a better organizational fit.

## On Titles

First, a little background. The institution I left did nothing to prepare me
for how things work "in the real world." I left a state institution where
upward mobility was, essentially, tied to moving institutions. In other words,
promotions were very rare and mostly only occurred by leaving one university
to go work for another university in [the system][usg]. Occassionally a
compensation bump would happen, but it was usually on the order of 3% and never
kept up with inflation. These things translated into not understanding one's
worth and not understanding what role titles mean to peers and potential
employeers (because the system didn't really care; you were just moving
from A to B in their view).

So, it has taken me a while to develop some understanding of the importance
of regularly (roughly) attaining a new title. Personally, a title doesn't
confer any special impetus upon me. I do not change how I approach my work
simply because my title is missing some qualifier. I believe, and everyone
I have spoken to concurs, that I have been operating at this "senior" level
since day one.

    It is understandable that I was not hired with that qualifier since
    I did switch careers and could not prove on paper my ability.

But it has become clear to me that titles do matter:

1. It gives others in the organization some idea of how you contribute to the
team. This is particularly true if the organization makes it clear how they
define roles. A great example is [Square's growth framework][square-blog].
Their public spreadsheet very clearly lays out what they expect from each
person with each respective title.

1. It shows personal, professional, growth to potential employers. While I
have no desire or expectation to ever leave my current organization, the only
guarantee the future offers is death. So it is important to be able to show
others outside of your organization that you have been able to meet rank up
thresholds. And, while they may not have as clear an insight into what that
role means as if they were considering someone from a place like Square, they
at least have some inkling of what to expect based on industry norms.

## Summary

In short, don't let your age or time invested in a current career stop you from
pursing your true desire. And don't let complacency or modesty hold you back.
Have frank discussions with whomever you need to about what it will take to
rank up, and accept it when it is offered. Otherwise, you could find yourself
at a severe disadvantage when you really don't need to be.
