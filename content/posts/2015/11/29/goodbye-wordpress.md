title: Goodbye Wordpress!

For the last five years this site has been generated by [Wordpress][wordpress].
The [decision][oldwelcome] to move to Wordpress was based primarily on the
ammount of spam that was being posted through the comment system I had written.
Wordpress provides some great tools for fighting comment spam. But comments
on weblog posts are becoming more irrelvant by the day; or rather, no one
does it anymore. So I don't have need of that feature any longer.

But that's not why I have dumped Wordpress. I have dumped Wordpress because
it is one giant security hole:

* http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/more-than-1-million-wordpress-websites-imperiled-by-critical-plugin-bug/
* http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/04/just-released-wordpress-0day-makes-it-easy-to-hijack-millions-of-websites/
* http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/04/as-many-as-1-million-sites-imperiled-by-dangerous-bug-in-wordpress-plugin/
* http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/04/swarm-of-wordpress-plugins-susceptible-to-potentially-dangerous-exploits/
* http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/05/actively-exploited-wordpress-bug-puts-millions-of-sites-at-risk/

I could keep linking stories of its vulnerabilities all day. Suffice it to say,
it is foolish to continue using Wordpress.

Given that fact, I decided to forego a dynamically generated website altogether.
This site is now completely static. This site is written in nothing more than
plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That used to come at a cost of
maintainability. It was far easier to use a dynamic content generator for a
site of any size if you wanted to be able to maintain it. Nowadays that isn't
the case. There are many, *many*, tools for generating static websites.
I even [wrote one][njsbaker] at one point (you probably shouldn't use it).

The tool I settled on using is [Metalsmith][metalsmith]. It's a very simple
tool with a lot of flexibility. I won't go over it in detail here. You can
[read about][robinthrift] in detail [elsewhere][okay3]. If you are curious
about the code to generate this site, you can peruse the
[git repository][jrfomrepo]. At the time of this writing the project is just
enough to get going.

If you're using Wordpress, and want to migrate off it, then I have written a
tool you might want to use -- [wp-to-static][wptostatic]. I had been wanting
to do this migration since early 2015, but it took me a while to finish
writing that tool (mostly due to laziness). I'm a firm believer in the
[301 code][http301]. As a result, all of my old content is still
[available][2015archive]; even my old *old* [content][2010archive].

Anyway, I have been holding off writing new posts because I didn't want to
add any more content to Wordpress. Now that I've moved on to this setup
I will maybe write more frequently. My current goal, though, is to come up with
some sort of better template/design.

Finally, I may consider adding [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comment system.
But it's unlikely. If you have something to say about a post, you can mention
[@jsumners79](https://twitter.com/jsumners79) on Twitter or
