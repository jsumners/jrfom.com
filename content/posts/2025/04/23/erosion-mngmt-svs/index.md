This post contains two reviews for a company I hired to deal with an erosion
problem in my yard. The original review resulted in the company coming back
to improve their work. They did not ask me to update, nor remove, my original
review. But I think it is important to provide an update, Google reviews
wouldn't even let me write all of the words I originally wanted to write (I
had to revise my review a bit to meet their word/character limit), and
archive.org is not allowed to archive Google reviews pages. So the original
review will be replicated below, and then my updated review (which I will
replace my original review with on Google's site).

## Original Review

> This review was left in February of 2025 for work performed in June (or July)
of 2024. The images referenced in the review are included at the bottom of this
section.
>
> First things first: I didn't want to write this review because there were
mistakes made on both sides; I was going to let bygones be bygones. Combined
with the overall summary that they did better than the first company I hired
for the same work, this is why I am giving a 2 instead of a 1 star rating. Now
on to the actual review.
>
> In early 2022 I contacted this company to spec out an erosion project in my
front yard. A year prior, I had had a landscaping company put in a berm and
drain to catch and divert water from washing out my yard. That berm failed due
to shoddy work. So the project manager came out to my house, we reviewed my
project, and he made several suggestions about what to do. Unfortunately, I had
to put the project on hold a couple of days later due to being caught up in a
mass layoff. Fast forward to 2023 when I have had a new job for a while and am
back in a financial position to do this work: I call them back to say I'm ready
to start the project again. Initially, they just wanted to come out and do it.
But it had been over a year, so I was adamant that they come out and re-review
the project. That should have been my warning, but the project manager came out
and looked at it again with me. He clearly didn't take any notes the first
time (which seems to be modus operandi), because when I asked about some of the
details HE had suggested the last time, he acted like I was asking for
something unheard of.
>
> Anyway, we pushed through with the project. They rebuilt the berm, added some
small river rocks around the drain, tied another drain in from further up the
hill, and added a French drain around one corner of my driveway. Once the work
was completed, the crew simply vanished. They never knocked on my door to let
me know they were finished. And the project manager had zero intention of
coming back to review the work; he was content to sign-off on the work from the
pictures his crew sent him. When I asked him to come out and review the work
with me, I got a very distinct impression that I was inconveniencing him. But
he did eventually come back out, and we agreed that some things had been
missed. His crew came back out, touched up the missing parts, and I decided to
let the project be finished.
>
> The rocks around the drain, which was the project manager's suggestion during
our very first review, were, as I understood the suggestion, meant to reinforce
the berm and alleviate sediment blocking the drain. We didn't really have any
significant rains until early this year (2025), so it never got thoroughly
tested. Well, the first hard, long, rain we got has resulted in the berm
overflowing, and it getting washed out along with my yard. Turns out, they had
covered up most of the drain with landscaping cloth and the rocks. Basically,
they half-assed it. I just had to remove the rocks and cloth in order to
determine if the drain was blocked ahead of our next forecasted heavy rain.
>
> Not only that, but the French drain that was put in was supposed to catch the
heavy runoff I have in that area and divert it to a lower location in my yard.
As can be seen in the attached pictures, this isn't quite working as intended.
I suppose it is catching most of it, but there is still washout happening, so
it clearly isn't sufficient.
>
> In addition to all of that, the grass seed they put down, and covered quite
poorly, never grew. I spent the last few warm months of 2024 meticulously
seeding and growing as much grass as I could on my own. Given it was so late,
there's still a lot to do this spring. What I discovered, is that they didn't
even seed the grass properly. They just threw some handfuls of seed on the
ground and tossed some straw on top of it. They didn't rake out any of the
unfiltered soil they put down in order to give the seed something to embed
into. And they didn't give me any instructions about how to maintain the work
to get any seed to grow.
>
> In summary, I have to make a bunch of repairs myself because they didn't do
things right.

## Updated Review

I'm revising my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars. I wanted to go up to 4, but
a couple of disappointments, that I will cover shortly, prevent that.

After writing my original reivew, the company reached out to determine what
they might be able to do to make things right. I scheduled a time for Mike to
come out and look at things with me. He agreed with me that the work was not
sufficient. He actually took some notes, and had a crew out the next week to
correct the issues. They built up a new berm, re-did the french drain and added
a swale to it, and put down erosion blanket to ensure the grass would have a
chance to grow. The next week, Mike came back out to review the work and
advise me about how to nuture it until it is settled in. He also mentioned he
would like to come back and apply hydroseed to the area just to make sure it
really takes.

Fast forward to April 2. I received a call from Mike in which he said he would
be out the following week (week of April 7) to take up the erosion blanket
and apply the hydroseed. I said I was planning to take up the blanket that very
day, but would wait for his crew to get it done. The next week came and went
without any communication. So did the next, until I needed to get my grass
cut before a trip. I spent 3 hours pulling the blanket, that I'm sure would been
significantly easier two week earlier, and taking it off to the dump. I never
got to cut my grass until the 23rd because that took up all the time and body
I had available to get work done before my trip on the 17th. My back,
unaccustomed to such work, was in pain and my finger tips and knees raw.
Thankfully my back recovered over night, but I still started my trip with
recovery on the other parts. I was finally able to do the work I had planned
to do on the 2nd, today, the 23rd, and I still had deal with leftover blanket
material (and probably will for months or years to come).

Aside from some landscaping blanket blotting my, now ineffective, original
berm, the work looks great and seems to be solving the problem, albeit
exacerbating another problem where the water now dumps out. I'm very pleased
to have my main issue seemingly solved. But I'm disappointed that promises I
didn't ask for were never kept. Please don't tell me you will do a thing and
then never even communicate that you aren't able to.
