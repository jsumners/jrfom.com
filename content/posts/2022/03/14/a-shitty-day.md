It's difficult to write this, but I feel like I need to write it down, however
random and sloppily it turns out:

I got laid off today.

I can't say the layoffs were a surprise. Internal events were telegraphing that
it was likely to happen. I was just crossing my fingers that I wouldn't be
included. I spent the past four years putting everything I could into making
[Knock a success]({{< ref "knock.md" >}}). I feel like I showed how capable I
am, and that I did tremendous work. But the company is [not doing
well](https://web.archive.org/web/20220315222047/https://therealdeal.com/2022/03/15/knock-it-off-homebuying-startup-ditches-ipo-plans/)
at all:

> The company on Tuesday announced a private fundraising round including $70
> million in equity and $150 million in new debt...
>
> The forecast pales in comparison to the $400 million to $500 million Knock
> hoped in March 2021 to raise in an IPO. At the time, Knock was aiming for a
> valuation of $2 billion; Black hasn’t disclosed the company’s valuation after
> the latest fundraising round, but cited money as a reason for the layoffs.

It also pales in comparison to the [$400m Series
B](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/knockaway/company_financials) round.

It really hurts to see my face right in the middle of the company picture in
[Sean's blog
post](https://web.archive.org/web/20220315222933/https://www.seanblack.com/blog/wild-ride-from-2b-to-220m).

The absence of the people that were let go will have a major impact. People with
a lot of knowledge around the building blocks of the whole platform were laid
off. The people remaining are really smart and will figure things out, but I do
not envy the road ahead of them.

I am trying to accept this whole thing and move forward. I have to keep
reminding myself that, regardless of what is written in the links above, the
market today is a strong one for people with my skills. I have to keep reminding
myself that I have a proven body of public work. And I have to keep reminding
myself that my time with Knock was an invaluable learning experience where I
grew significantly in many ways.

But for today, it's really, really, hard to let all of that sink in.

To close out, I'm leaving a few of the kind words my colleagues said about me
during my tenure there. The names are redacted as I don't have their permission,
but I doubt they will mind me sharing some amount of positivity on this
terrible day.
